# Notice
They new Keygen function being used called Argon2 that relies on system resources. It is recomended to have at least 8GB of ram/memory when making a key.

I have not tested with like 4GB of ram/memory but a virtual machine with 2GB of ram will not work. If you have a system with 4GB or memmory/ram, please try it out and then get back to me in the [discussions](https://github.com/therealOri/Genter/discussions/14) area.

# Download
- [Genter_v2.1.14_Linux](https://therealori.tk/projects/genter/gen.html)

Always make sure the hashes in the checksums.txt file match what you have downloaded. No matter what you download on the interent. It never hurts to be sure.

# Verification
If you download the linux binary from my website, make sure to verify the file by doing the following tasks.

- Make sure you have "[Signify](https://github.com/aperezdc/signify)" installed on your system.
- Git clone "[Signipy](https://github.com/therealOri/Signipy)" and use it to verify.

Here are the file's you'll need to verify the .exe file.
- "genter_linux_pub_key.pub"
- "Genter_v2.1.14_Linux.sig"

If you can't do these steps then make sure to take a look at the "checksum.txt" file and make sure the hashes match what you have downloaded.
