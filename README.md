# PassGen
PassGen will allow you to create a very crazy & strong randomized password.
You can manually pick and choose what languages and symbols are used. You can also change the length of the password and how many you want to generate. Also, In addition to the password generator, PassGen has a built in password manager that you can use! Passwords are encrypted using AES and a "Password Based Key Derivation" master Key.

Update | 10/27/2022:
# New Features.
If you have an older version of this project, You should update to the current version now!.

Added:
> - I have made a windows executeable for those who use windows and don't have python3 or don't want to install and use python and everything. I will however not be paying $100s for a cert for the exe so you'll just have to deal with any popups or false positives if any even happen to begin with. I used [Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) for the making of the .exe file. I had to make its own windows version of passgen because windows is just that way.

<br />

If you come across ANY issues or bugs, please report it by making an [issue](https://github.com/therealOri/PassGen/issues). It helps out a lot!
> This is my first time making a .exe file so I would love any feedback on what could be done better or changed. <3

# Installation/Links

> If you do not have "virtualenv", you can install it via pip.
```mkd
pip install virtualenv
```

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/therealOri/PassGen.git
cd PassGen
virtualenv pgenENV
source pgenENV/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 passgen.py
```
> The first thing you should do is make a 100+ character password, generate a key, and then keep it safe for when you want to use the password manager.

# Extra/Notes
> - If you don't have python3, then you can find, download, and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). (Or from your package manager of choice).
> - If you are on windows 10 use this: [download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/python-3.10.7-amd64.exe). (Pip3 comes with it)
> - The hashing feature of this script can be completly ignorred if you are just making passwords. Hashing is for if you want to store them in a server somewhere, so they aren't just sat around as plaintext.
> - If the "options_flag" in the config file is set to "true", PassGen will ask you what you want to use in your password. If set to "False", PassGen will use the already defined list of options that are all "True" by default found in the code. (Basically will use everything).
> - If the "secure_prompts" option in the config file is "true", it will hide what you type whenever you are asked to provide keys, salts, passwords, etc. If it is set to "false" it will not hide what you type.

# Notice! ðŸ’¢
It is very important to keep backups of your keys and data as without it you CAN NOT decrypt your passwords or recover anything. It is advised that you keep a backup of your master key and password database file as well on a USB or external SSD. If in the event of anything getting compromized and you need to change your key and encrypted data/your passwords that used your key, you can change your key and encryption automatically using passgen.

By using PassGen you understand the risk of data encryption and the always possible risk of losing data. I am hereby not liable or responisble for any loss of data and or if you lose your key and are unable to decrypt your passwords/data. Everything lies in your hands in terms of how well you keep your master key safe and your data backed up.
