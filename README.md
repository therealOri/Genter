# Passgen
Passgen will allow you to create a very/crazy strong password that will also be randomized.
You can change up what is used, add more stuff, or remove some things if you wish. You can also change the length of the password and how many you want to generate too.

Update | 3/29/2022:
# Menu Overhaul & More features.
If you have an older version of this project, You should update to the current version now!.

> - Added a new function to clear the contents of "pass.txt" in the menu. (For after you make a password so it doesn't just sit there in the file)

# Extra/Notes
> - If you don't have python3, then you can find, download, and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). (Or from your package manager of choice).
> - If you are on windows 10 use this: [download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.3/python-3.10.3-amd64.exe). (Pip3 comes with it)
> - The hashing feature of this script can be completly ignorred if you are just making passwords. Hashing is for if you want to store them in a server somewhere, so they aren't just sat around as plaintext.
