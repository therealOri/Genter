# Notice
They new Keygen function being used called Argon, and it relies on system resources. It is recomended to have at least 8GB of ram/memory when making a key.

I have not tested with like 4GB of ram/memory but a virtual machine with 2GB of ram will not work. If you have a system with 4GB of memmory/ram, please try it out and then get back to me in the [discussions](https://github.com/therealOri/Genter/discussions/14) area.

# Download
- [Genter_v2.1.14_Windows.exe](https://therealori.tk/projects/genter/gen.html)
__ __

<br />

If you want to compile the source yourself then you can run the following command to compile to .exe.

To install - `pip install Nuitka`

Install requirements - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To compile - `nuitka --follow-imports windows_source_genter.py` (This file can be renamed if you want.)

# Verification
If you download the .exe from my website, make sure to verify the file by doing the following tasks.

- Make sure you have "[Signify](https://github.com/aperezdc/signify)" installed on your system.
- Git clone "[Signipy](https://github.com/therealOri/Signipy)" and use it to verify.
__ __
Here are the file's you'll need to verify the .exe file.
- "genter_windows_pub_key.pub"
- "Genter_v2.1.14_Windows.exe.sig"

If you can't do these steps then make sure to take a look at the "checksum.txt" file and make sure the hashes match what you have downloaded.
