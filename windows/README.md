# Notice
They new Keygen function being used called Argon, and it relies on system resources. It is recomended to have at least 8GB of ram/memory when making a key.

I have not tested with like 4GB of ram/memory but a virtual machine with 2GB of ram will not work. If you have a system with 4GB of memmory/ram, please try it out and then get back to me in the [discussions](https://github.com/therealOri/Genter/discussions/14) area.
